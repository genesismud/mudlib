	fights <on/off>       fights or not. This is particularly useful if

	wimpy <level>       - With this option you can become a wimp and wimpy
			      out of a fight if it does not go well for you.
			      However, when running away from the fight, you
			      will have no time to decide where to run and you
			      might end up in the next room with a dozen more
			      of those horrible beasts. Most times it will
			      probably save your life. The <level> can be:

		   brave    - Never run, be brave!
	           <damage> - The health description of the unacceptable
			      damage level.
		   ?        - Give a list of available <damage> strings.
